# cyto-acoustics

## About

This is the result of a short hackathon, which theme/goal was defined as "Let's create a tonematrix with webaudio! And make it a Game of Life too, cause why not. Also let's do it in Elm as to learn something new."

Most of the code is Elm, but for some bits of html and the webaudio part.

## Build

```shell
elm-make src/Cyto-acoustics.elm --output target/cyto-acoustics.js
```

Then open index.html

## Live demo

Warning, this is an audio demo, clicking play/step will possibly cause <b>loud noises</b>!
